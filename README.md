### Abstrat 
The main focues of this study is to predict heart disease based on the clincal data set contianing patient attributes. By analyzing this data set, it can be possible to predict heart disease by developing machine learning model.

### Introduction 

CVascular Disease (VDs) are a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels. According to the WHO, Heart disease is leading causes of death worldwide, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year. There is a massive amount of data in the healthcare industry, and processing this amount of data is a tedious task. A computer-aided system that predicts cardiac disease can save time and money.  Those at highest risk of CVDs and ensuring they receive appropriate treatment can prevent premature deaths.

### Problem Statment 
Counties across the U.S. show significant variability in heart disease mortality rates, with disparities across race, age groups, and gender. There is a need to predict which counties are likely to experience higher mortality rates based on historical trends and demographic data.Heart disease and stroke mortality rates differ significantly across race, age groups, and gender, but the trend and extent of these disparities over time are unclea
### Goals of the Project
The goal of the project is to identify counties with higher heart disease and stroke mortality rates, analyzing trends over time, and predicting future mortality rates using machine learning.
