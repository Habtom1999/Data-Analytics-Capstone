### Abstrat 
The main focues of this study is to predict heart disease based on the clincal data set contianing patient attributes. By analyzing this data set, it can be possible to predict heart disease by developing machine learning model.

### Introduction 

Cardio vascular Disease (VDs) are a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels. According to the WHO, Heart disease is leading causes of death worldwide, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year. There is a massive amount of data in the healthcare industry, and processing this amount of data is a tedious task. A computer-aided system that predicts cardiac disease can save time and money.  Those at highest risk of CVDs and ensuring they receive appropriate treatment can prevent premature deaths.

### Problem Statment 
Identifying individuals at risk of heart disease is crucial for preventing adverse outcomes and improving patient prognosis.leverage a dataset containing various patient health attributes — including age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more — to analyze and predict the likelihood of heart disease
### Goals of the Project
The objective of this project is to leverage a dataset containing various patient health attributes — including age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more — to analyze and predict the likelihood of heart disease. By using data analytics and machine learning techniques, this project will develop a predictive model capable of distinguishing between high-risk and low-risk patients

### Data Set 
This dataset, obtained from Kaggle, contains 11 commonly measured features associated with cardiovascular health and disease risk. It includes key patient health attributes such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiogram (ECG) results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, oldpeak (ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest), and the ST slope. With around 918 observations, this dataset provides a robust foundation for the development of predictive models.
