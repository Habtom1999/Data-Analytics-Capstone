This study examines county-level trends in heart disease and stroke mortality rates across the United States from 2000 to 2019.By identifying counties with the highest mortality rates and analyzing patterns across two time intervals (2000–2010 and 2010–2019), the study aims to highlight geographic and demographic disparities in cardiovascular health outcomes. Additionally, machine learning models are implemented to predict future mortality trends, providing insights to inform targeted public health interventions and resource allocation
